#' @description A flowFrame obtained from a 36ab-panel single-staining experimante.
#' 
#' @details 36ab-panel: Beads were stained for antibodies captured by mass channels 
#' 139, 141 through 156, and 158 through 176, respectively, and pooled together.
#' Here we sampled a fraction of all recorded events to demonstrate the debarcoding and
#' compensation work-flow, at the cost of not necessarily arriving at satisfying results.
